# JavaGuiCalculator
You will be required to form a small team (expect 2- 3 members max). 
You will agree the scope of the project with the Lecturer. You will use GItHub to host all files.

Your project will be marked on:

The complexity of the GUI and its functionality.
Effective use of GIT for source code management for the development of the GUI.
The development of documentation to support your project submission.

My Gui will be based on a simple calculator model.
